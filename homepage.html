    <h2>Anosha's Experience with Coding!</h2>
        <p>I am currently in my third year of graphic design at OCADU and it’s my fourth year here! I was first admitted into the expanded animation program and switched to graphic design after a year.</p>
        <p>During my first year I took a course called art and code, I had never seen any generative art before and found it extremely interesting. We used processing or p5 to create art with randomized outputs and our final project was to use an Arduino to create art in real life.</p>
        <p>My first introduction to coding was when I took computer science and computer engineering as electives in high school. I remember making simple websites with requirements such as drop-down menus and learning about converting ohms, breadboards, circuits, etc. I still remember writing “hello world” for the first time and not really understanding what console.log even is.</p>
        <p>My knowledge in programming is still at the beginner level I think because I have only taken introduction to coding courses as electives so far apart and I haven’t had to practice often.</p>
        <p>I am probably the most comfortable using html/css and it’s the only language I found was easy to understand at first. I also enjoy making aesthetic choices through css. </p>

    <h2>My Passion for Reading</h2>
        <p>I have recently become extremely passionate about reading. Even though I’ve  loved reading since I was young. My parents still recall me always falling asleep with a book open.</p>
        <p>I’ve started to do more research and found books I connect to that make me feel seen. Reading allows me to bring different perspective to my own life by reading about people or circumstances I would never encounter in my own small world.</p>
        <p>I recently read The Catcher in the Rye for the first-time last month and my favourite part is how the main character describes wanting an author to be one of your best friends and being able to just call them to talk about anything, that’s when you know you read a good book.</p>
        <p>I love reading classic novels or contemporary books. I have also started trading books with people on Facebook Marketplace or Instagram and I love meeting people who also love to read. I’m hoping to build a mini library this summer on my lawn for people to take a book and leave one.</p>
        <p>Here are a few of my favourite books:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Goldfinch by Donna Tart</li>
            <li>The Little Friend by Donna Tart</li>
            <li>The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath</li>
            <li>The 7½ Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle by Stuart Turton</li>
            <li>10 minutes 38 seconds in This Strange World by Elif Shafak</li>
        </ul>
